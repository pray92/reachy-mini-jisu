# Reachy Mini API Documentation

*⚠️ All examples shown below suppose that you have already started the Reachy Mini daemon, either by running `reachy-mini-daemon` or by using the Python module `reachy_mini.daemon.app.main`. ⚠️*

## ReachyMini

Reachy Mini's API is designed to be simple and intuitive. You will mostly interact with the `ReachyMini` class, which provides methods to control the robot's joints such as the head and antennas and interact with its sensors.

The first step is to instantiate the `ReachyMini` class. This can be done as follows:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini

mini = ReachyMini()
```

This will connect to the Reachy Mini daemon, which is responsible for managing the hardware communication with the robot's motors and sensors. As soon as the `ReachyMini` instance is created, it will automatically connect to the daemon and initialize the robot's components. 

To ensure that the connection is properly established and cleaned up, it is recommended to use the `with` statement when working with the `ReachyMini` class. This will automatically handle the connection and disconnection of the daemon:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    # Your code here
```

### Moving the robot

Then, the next step is to show how to move the robot. The `ReachyMini` class provides methods called `set_target` and `goto_target` that allows you to move the robot's head to a specific target position. You can control:
* the head's position and orientation
* the body's rotation angle
* the antennas' position

The `head_frame` is positioned at the base of the head, as you can see in the image below. This is the frame you are controling when using `set_target` and `goto_target`.

[![Reachy Mini Head Frame](/docs/assets/head_frame.png)]()

For instance, to move the head of the robot slightly to the left then go back, you can use the following code:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose

with ReachyMini() as reachy:
    # Move the head to a specific position
    reachy.goto_target(head=create_head_pose(y=-10, mm=True))

    # Goes back to the initial position
    reachy.goto_target(head=create_head_pose(y=0, mm=True))
```

Let's break down the code:

* First, `create_head_pose(y=-10, mm=True)` creates a pose for the head where the y-axis is set to -10 mm. The `mm=True` argument indicates that the value is in millimeters. 
The pose is a 4x4 transformation matrix that defines the position and orientation of the head. You can print the pose to see its values.
```python
print(create_head_pose(y=-10, mm=True))
>>>
[[ 1.   0.   0.   0.  ]
 [ 0.   1.   0.  -0.01]
 [ 0.   0.   1.   0.  ]
 [ 0.   0.   0.   1.  ]]
```

* Then, this matrix is passed to the `goto_target` method, as the head target.

The `goto_target` method accept more arguments, such as `duration` to specify how long the movement should take. By default, its duration is set to 0.5 seconds, but you can change it to any value you want:

```python
reachy.goto_target(head=create_head_pose(y=-10, mm=True), duration=2.0)
```

You can also orient the head by passing additional arguments to the `create_head_pose` function. For example, to roll the head 15 degrees while moving it up 10 mm, you can do:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose

with ReachyMini() as reachy:
    # Move the head up (10mm on z-axis) and roll it 15 degrees
    pose = create_head_pose(z=10, roll=15, degrees=True, mm=True)
    reachy.goto_target(head=pose, duration=2.0)

    # Reset to default pose
    pose = create_head_pose() 
    reachy.goto_target(head=pose, duration=2.0)
```


You can also make the antennas move by passing the `antennas` argument to the `goto_target` method. For example, to move the antennas to a specific position:

```python
import numpy as np

from reachy_mini import ReachyMini

with ReachyMini() as reachy:
    # Move the antennas to a specific position
    reachy.goto_target(antennas=np.deg2rad([45, 45]), duration=1.0)

    # Reset the antennas to their initial position
    reachy.goto_target(antennas=[0, 0], duration=1.0)
```

You need to pass the angles in radians, so you can use `numpy.deg2rad` to convert degrees to radians. The first value in the list corresponds to the right antenna, and the second value corresponds to the left antenna.

You can also move the head, the body and the antennas at the same time by passing all three arguments to the `goto_target` method:

```python
import numpy as np

from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose

with ReachyMini() as reachy:
    # Move the head and antennas to a specific position
    reachy.goto_target(
        head=create_head_pose(y=-10, mm=True),
        antennas=np.deg2rad([45, 45]),
        duration=2.0,
        body_yaw=np.deg2rad(30)
    )
```

Finally, you can also select the interpolation method used. By default, the interpolation method is set to "minjerk", but you can change it to "linear", "cartoon" or "ease".

```python
import numpy as np

from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose

with ReachyMini() as reachy:
    # Move the head and antennas to a specific position
    reachy.goto_target(
        head=create_head_pose(y=10, mm=True),
        antennas=np.deg2rad([-45, -45]),
        duration=2.0,
        method="cartoon",  # can be "linear", "minjerk", "ease" or "cartoon"
    )
```

If you want to test the different interpolation methods, you can run the [goto_interpolation_playground.py](../examples/goto_interpolation_playground.py) example, which will illustrate the differences between the interpolation methods when running the `goto_target` method.

You can also use the `set_target` method to set the target position of the head and antennas. It will use the same head pose and antennas arguments. This method is useful if you want the robot to move immediately to a specific position without any interpolation. It can be useful to control the movement at a high frequency. For example, to make the head follows a sinusoidal trajectory:

```python
import time
import numpy as np

from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose

with ReachyMini() as reachy:
    # Set the initial target position
    reachy.set_target(head=create_head_pose(y=0, mm=True))

    start = time.time()
    while True:
        # Calculate the elapsed time
        t = time.time() - start

        if t > 10:
            break  # Stop after 10 seconds

        # Calculate the new target position
        y = 10 * np.sin(2 * np.pi * 0.5 * t)  # Sinusoidal trajectory
        # Set the new target position
        reachy.set_target(head=create_head_pose(y=y, mm=True))

        time.sleep(0.01)
```

⚠️ <b>BEWARE: Mini's head range of motion is limited</b> ⚠️


When it comes to the reachy mini's head, it is important to note that it has several physical limitations of its head and body position and orientation 
capabilities. Such as:
1. The robots motors have a limited range of motion
2. The robot's head can collide with the body
3. The robot's body rotation (body yaw) is limited to [-180, 180] degrees.

In addition to the physical limitations, the robot has several software safety features that limit the head's position and orientation. These safety features are designed to prevent the robot from moving to unsafe positions or orientations that could cause damage to the robot or its surroundings.

4. The head's pitch and roll angles are limited to [-40, 40] degrees.
5. The head's yaw angle is limited to [-180, 180] degrees
6. The difference between the body yaw and head yaw angles is limited to [-65, 65] degrees.

If any of these limits are exceeded, the robot will move to the closest valid position within the limits.

For example, if you try to move the head to an orientation that exceeds the limits, such as:

```python
reachy.goto_target(head=create_head_pose(roll=-50, degrees=True))
```

The robot will not be able to follow due to the safety limit 4.

Or another example, if you try to move the body yaw to an angle that exceeds the limits, such as:

```python
reachy.goto_target(
    head=create_head_pose(yaw=10, degrees=True), body_yaw=np.deg2rad(100)
)
```

The robot will not be able to follow the command exactly due to the safety limit 6.

Reachy mini will not throw an error if you exceed these limits, but it will move to the closest valid position within the limits. You can check the current position of the head using the `get_current_head_pose` method of the `ReachyMini` instance. For example:

```python
import time 

from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose

reachy = ReachyMini()

# construct a head pose with roll -20 degrees
pose = create_head_pose(roll=-20, degrees=True)
reachy.goto_target(head=pose)
time.sleep(1)  # wait for the movement to complete
# get the current head pose
head_pose = reachy.get_current_head_pose()
print("current head pose", head_pose)
print("target head pose", pose)
```

### Look at

To make the robot look at a specific point, we provide look_at methods. 

The `look_at_image` method allows the robot to look at a point in the image coordinates. The image coordinates are defined as a 2D point in the camera's image plane, where (0, 0) is the top-left corner of the image and (width, height) is the bottom-right corner. Similarly to the `goto_target` method, you can specify the duration of the movement.

You can see the example in [look_at_image.py](../examples/look_at_image.py).

There is also a `look_at_world` method that allows the robot to look at a point in the world coordinates. The world coordinates are defined as a 3D point in the robot's coordinate system.

[![Reachy Mini World Frame](/docs/assets/world_frame.png)]()

### Enable/disable motors and compliancy


You can control the robot's motors with three main methods:

1. **`enable_motors`**: Powers on the motors, making the robot ready to move and respond to commands. In this mode, the robot holds its position and you cannot move it by hand.

2. **`disable_motors`**: Powers off the motors. The robot will not respond to commands, but you can move it freely by hand (no resistance).

3. **`make_motors_compliant`**: Makes the motors compliant (requires motors to be enabled first). In this mode, the motors are powered on, but they do not resist external forces, so you can move the robot by hand, and it will feel "soft". This is useful for safe manual manipulation or teaching by demonstration. For an example, see the [gravity compensation example](../examples/reachy_compliant_demo.py): in this demo, you can move the robot's head and antennas freely, but the robot will use its motors to compensate for gravity and maintain its position/orientation in space.

### Recording moves
Let's assume that you have a script that uses the `set_target` fonction to move the robot and you want to record the commands to be able to replay them.
For example, this could be a teleoperation script, and you could be recording cute emotions (OK this is how we did it).
You can create another ReachyMini client (or use the same) and simply use `start_recording()` and `stop_recording()`.
Below is the snippet of code that show how to start a recording, stop the recording and unpack the data:
```python
import time

from reachy_mini import ReachyMini


with ReachyMini() as mini:
    data = {
        "description": "TODO: describe what you captured.",
        "time": [],
        "set_target_data": [],
    }

    try:
        # The daemon will start recording the set_target() calls
        mini.start_recording()
        print("\nRecording started. Press Ctrl+C here to stop recording.")

        while True:
            # Keep the script alive to listen for Ctrl+C
            time.sleep(0.01)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        # Stop recording and retrieve the logged data
        recorded_motion = mini.stop_recording()

    for frame in recorded_motion:
        data["time"].append(frame.get("time"))
        pose_info = {
            "head": frame.get("head"),
            "antennas": frame.get("antennas"),
            "body_yaw": frame.get("body_yaw"),
        }
        data["set_target_data"].append(pose_info)
```

We also provide [tools](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_toolbox/tree/main/tools/moves) to record and upload a dataset to the hub, that can be easily replayed later. See [This section](#playing-moves)

## Accessing the sensors

Reachy Mini comes with several sensors (camera, microphone, speaker) that are connected to your computer via USB through the robot. These devices are accessible via the `reachy_mini.media` object.

### Camera

A camera frame can be easily retrieved as follows:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini

with ReachyMini() as reachy_mini:
    while True:
        frame = reachy_mini.media.get_frame()
        # frame is a numpy array as output by opencv
```

Please refer to the example: [look_at_image](../examples/look_at_image.py).

### Microphone

Audio samples from the microphone can be obtained as follows:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    while True:
        sample = mini.media.get_audio_sample()
        # sample is a numpy array as output by sounddevice
```

Please refer to the example [sound_record](../examples/debug/sound_record.py).

### Speaker

Audio samples can be pushed to the speaker as follows:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    while True:
        # get audio chunk from mic / live source / file
        mini.media.push_audio_sample(chunk)
```
Please refer to the example: [sound_play](../examples/debug/sound_play.py).

### GStreamer Backend

By default, OpenCV manages the camera, and sounddevice manages the audio. Advanced users can use the GStreamer backend, which enables the creation of more complex media pipelines and provides better control over audio/video latency. The above examples can be started with the `--backend gstreamer` argument.
To enable the use of the GStreamer backend, the package should be installed as follows:


```bash
pip install -e ".[gstreamer]"
```

It is assumed that the [gstreamer binaires](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/download/) are properly installed on your system. You will likely want to configure your own pipeline. See [gstreamer camera](../src/reachy_mini/media/camera_gstreamer.py) for an example.

## Playing moves

You can also play predefined moves simply. You can find an example on how to do this in the [recorded moves example](../examples/recorded_moves_example.py) examples.

Basically, you just need to load the move from the dataset you want. And run the `play_move` method on a `ReachyMini` instance.

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.motion.recorded_move import RecordedMoves

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    recorded_moves = RecordedMoves("pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-dances-library")
    print(recorded_moves.list_moves())

    for move_name in recorded_moves.list_moves():
        print(f"Playing move: {move_name}")
        mini.play_move(recorded_moves.get(move_name), initial_goto_duration=1.0)
```

The `initial_goto_duration` argument for `play_move()` allows you to smoothly go to the starting position of the move before starting to execute it.

The datasets are hosted on the Hugging Face Hub ([for example](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pollen-robotics/reachy-mini-emotions-library))

We provide tools to record and upload a dataset [here](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_toolbox/tree/main/tools/moves).
